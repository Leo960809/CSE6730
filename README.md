# Tutorial: Workers' Safety Behavior in Construction Site

In this project, we are modeling and simulating workers’ safety behavior in the construction site. Workers’  safety behavior are categoried into two types: (1) safety risk adverse and (2) safety risk taking based on their risk preference when considering taking safety measures. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and dynamics on networks methods(Cellular Automata mainly) to study the system. The goal of the study is to observe the dynamics of the workers’ safety behaviors over a certain period of time.


* **[Part 0]**: Background of the topic 
* **[Part 1]**: This notebook is to simulate the change of workers' safety behavior with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. 
* **[Part 2]**: This part explains how to use and implement dynamics on networks methods to study the workers' safety behavior in constuction site. The main dynamical model we apply to the network is Cellular Automata. (not included in this repo)
